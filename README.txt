POST

/* This is my second personal project inspired by kevin skoglund's lynda.com/PHP with MySQL Essential training. I was kinda new to PHP OOP when I developed it so I created methods for most functionality. Others, I wrote them on the the whole code on the same page it was intended for. But nevertheless, it doesn't change the fact that it still works */

1. import the 'post.sql' to get you started. Database name used here is 'post' but you are free to change it in 'credentials/secure.php'. You could put in your personal database credentials here as well

2. Go to 'core/init.php' and change the 'SITE_ROOT' relative to your server root. If the 'post' folder is inside your server root directly, '/post' would do just fine.

3. To get started, you need to sign up and login.

- Adding subjects and pages is pretty easy. After you login, It's almost impossible to miss your way around
